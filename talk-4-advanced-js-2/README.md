## Outline

### Scope
- In JavaScript (<Es5), blocks do not have scopes, only objects (and functions) have scopes

### Function and variable hoisting
- 

### Callbacks
- 

### TCO

ES6 stands to change that, but it's still something to keep in mind with recusive functions in JavaScript, which, as it stands, is not tail-call optimized for recursive calls. ES6 stands to change that, but it's still something to keep in mind with recusive functions in JavaScript, which, as it stands, is not tail-call optimized for recursive calls. ES6 stands to change that, but it's still something to keep in mind with recusive functions in `Maximum call stack size exceeded`
- Callstacks vary pretty wildly between browser implementations.

### Closures
- 
- It is possible to emulate private elements with closures.

### Design Patterns
- Pub/Sub, or observer pattern
