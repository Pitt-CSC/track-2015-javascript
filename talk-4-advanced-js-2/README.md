# Advanced JS 2

---

## Outline

---

## JS Inheritance
- JavaScript is object-oriented; most things in JS are objects.
- JS is also class-less

----

##  Classical Inheritance
-

----

## Prototypal Inheritance

----

## The Prototype Chain


---

## Design Patterns
- Patterns are resuable, easy, proven solutions to common problem archetypes.
- Patterns provide structure.
- Patterns are broad and flexible abstractions.
- Patterns provide a common vocabulary.

Note: Design patterns are just that: patterns, pattens to common issues that arise and patterns for normal development. They provide a cohesion to the chaos that is JavaScript. They are less of a cookbook  or algorithm and more of a expressive description. They allow developers to communicate using common phrases. Think: the encapsulation pattern in Java.

----

## Common JS Anti-Patterns
- Polluting the global namespace.
- Using JavaScript in an inline form as this is inflexible
- Using setTimeout or setInterval on async calls.
- Modifying the Object class prototype

Note: These are common pitfalls to avoid. Polutting the global namespace and inline JS in the web is almost a deliberate lack of design, but acceptable in extremely small use-cases. setTimeout and setInerval are notoriously dangerous patterns, using the term loosely; we will see common ways to combat this later with callbacks, promises, and async/await. Modifying the built-in object types has potentially disasterous side-effects. This list is not exhaustive, but it does cover most of the basics.
