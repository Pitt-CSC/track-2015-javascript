# Functional Programming in Javascript

## Outline

### What is Functional Programming?

### Where is Functional Programming useful?
- Especially in UI manipulation.
- In prohibition-themed bars, functional programming can be used to impress equally hipster programmers while twirling your handlebar mustache and drinking from mason jars.

### But why JavaScript
- JavaScript is actually a highly functional language.
- For example: First-class functions, closures, currying, weak object orientation.
- Still, it's not a perfect vehicle for functional Programming. And it doesn't need to be: we can benefit from the broad strokes of functional programming while maintaining the exporessiveness of JavaScript.

### Functional programming concepts: Immutability
- Creating a new object with `Object.assign({}, ...)` or copying arrays with `[].concat()`, rather than mutating the original object. 

### Functional Programming in other languages
- Scala and Haskell are heralded as true functional languages.
- ClojureScript is a compile-to-JavaScript implementation of the functional language, Clojure.
